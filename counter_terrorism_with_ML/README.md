## TerrorAI - Counter Terrorism With Machine Learning

Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means
to create terror, or fear, to achieve a political, religious or ideological aim. It is a growing
problem in every country, leading to destruction of life and property. With growing times,
terrorist organizations are also getting bolder and more sophisticated.

The increase in terrorist activities in the world has made it necessary for us to analyze and
understand this issue as well as take appropriate action against it. It is of extreme need to
develop an early warning system for such attacks. We aim to do exactly that. This project
involves taking in data from the Global Terrorism Database and running Machine learning
algorithms on it.

Machine Learning can be used to predict what sort of target demography can be attacked in the
future and the type of attacks that a terrorist organization can make. This helps experts in
understanding why an attack has taken place and hence enables them to understand terrorists
and their movements better.

This project focuses on predicting the target demography (region) as well as the attack type
that can take place using Logistic Regression and Decision tree algorithms on The Global
Terrorism Dataset that has been preprocessed.
